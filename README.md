Need wireframes and JS/JQ planned usage

Started with a very simple idea with multiple pages and linking them.

As I was making divs I thought of a fun website game where you cannot let the mouse
touch certain areas and decided I wanted to do that on my landing pages

Now I am condensing everything onto one page for this.

I want to make it so people can play the game but they don't have to if they do not want to.

This is also good for me cause I have to use a bit of CSS to make it work right and I need to get better at CSS.

Need to use JS to change hover color permanently?

Having a hard time finding ways to make the game interactive with JQuery.

Working on getting hamburger working. Got it to toggle but having a hard time getting the icon to display properly

okay got on mouse over working for the JQ. thought it would be hover but it is mouse over.

Style is coming together. Just need to make the game portion more robust
